# Prometheus Chains
**Credibly neutral healthcare rails on Ethereum.**

We’re building an **open protocol for healthcare**:  
- **Patient-owned records** — anchored on Ethereum L1 for integrity, encrypted on L2 for privacy.  
- **Instant claims & payments** — providers submit, rules enforce, funds settle in seconds.  
- **Neutral standards** — no gatekeepers; anyone can build on the rails.
